Hi all, welcome to my place on the internet. I'm planning using this space to write about the software challenges I come across in my day to day, dive into technical areas I wish to learn more, and anything else I feel compelled to write about. As part of my posts I also plan on including some music I'm enjoying and whatever else I found interesting while scouring the internet.  Hope you enjoy the content!
