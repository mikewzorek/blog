title: Sharing Private S3 Object With Presigned URLs

author: Mike Wzorek
summary: I came across a problem at work the other day where I needed to be able to show a preview of, and allow our users to download, a variety of different types of content from a web app, i.e. videos, images, open office docs, pdfs, etc. that are stored in a private S3 bucket. The solution that I found, was to generate a pre-signed URL.  A pre-signed URL allows you to grant temporary access to users who don’t have permission to directly run AWS operations in your account. A pre-signed URL is signed with your AWS credentials and can be used by any user.

I came across a problem at work the other day where I needed to be able to show a preview of, and allow our users to download, a variety of different types of content from a web app, i.e. video, image, Open Office files, PDF, etc. that are stored in a private S3 bucket

The solution that I found was to generate a pre-signed URL.  A pre-signed URL allows you to grant temporary access to users who don’t have permission to directly run AWS operations in your account. A pre-signed URL is signed with your AWS credentials and can be used by any user.

Our API is built in Node.js so I took advantage of the AWS SDK to get the pre-signed URL.

First install the AWS SDK.
`yarn install aws-sdk` or `npm install aws-sdk`.

Next initialize the S3 client in the class constructor.

``` typescript
import AWS, { S3 } from 'aws-sdk';

export class S3Service {
  s3: S3;
  constructor() {
    super();
    AWS.config.update({
      region: 'us-east-1', // the region your s3 bucket is in.
      accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, // I'm using environment variables to store my secrets
      secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
    });
    this.s3 = new S3();
  }
// ...
}
```

There is a few things going on in the implementation, some of which are beyond returning a signed url, but I figured it would be useful to include them.  I’ll list them out in order of operations and include the full code snippet towards the end:

1. Based on the S3 Object `key`  passed into the function I’m grabbing the file type and extension using a lightweight MIME type module, [GitHub - broofa/mime: Mime types for JavaScript](https://github.com/broofa/mime)

```typescript
import mime from 'mime'
// ...
const type = mime.getType(key); // key = '/my/folder/path/object.pdf'
const extension = mime.getExtension(type || '');
// ...
```

2. Set up the parameters to get the signed url.  You will notice a bit of conditional logic in determining the `ResponseContentType`.  What’s going on there is that if the `contentType` variable I instantiated in the first step is an image type, i.e.  jpeg, png, etc., I want to the pre-signed url header to include the content-type header equal to `’binary/octet-stream'`.  Returning the image pre-signed URLs like this allows us to show a preview of the image in our web app, but also make them download-able.

```typescript
const getSignedUrlParams = {
   Bucket: s3Bucket, // 'name-of-your-s3-bucket'
   Key: key, // key = '/my/folder/path/object.pdf'
   Expires: 3600, // time in seconds (3600 = 1 hour).  Default is 15 minutes.
   ResponseContentType: isImageContentType(contentType as string) ? 'binary/octet-stream' : contentType,
};
```

3. Lastly, I call the `getSignedUrlPromise` function and return the string URL response.  I’m using the promise based function because I am making this request in an asynchronous context.

```typescript
const signedUrl = await this.s3.getSignedUrlPromise(‘getObject’, getSignedUrlParams);
return {
    signedUrl,
    contentType: type || ‘’,
    extension: extension || ‘’,
};
```

Bringing it all together, here’s the full implementation:

```typescript
import AWS, { S3 } from 'aws-sdk';
import mime from 'mime';

interface S3SignedUrlResponse {
  signedUrl: string;
  contentType: string;
  extension: string;
}

export class S3Service {
  s3: S3;
  constructor() {
    super();
    AWS.config.update({
      region: 'us-east-1',
      accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
      secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
    });
    this.s3 = new S3();
  }

  async getS3ObjectSignedUrl(s3Bucket: string, key: string): Promise<S3SignedUrlResponse> {
    try {
      const contentType = mime.getType(key); // key = '/my/folder/path/object.pdf'
      const extension = mime.getExtension(type || '');
      const getSignedUrlParams = {
        Bucket: s3Bucket, // 'name-of-your-s3-bucket'
        Key: key,
        Expires: 3600, // time in seconds (3600 = 1 hour)
        ResponseContentType: isImageContentType(contentType as string) ? 'binary/octet-stream' : contentType,
      };
      const signedUrl = await this.s3.getSignedUrlPromise('getObject', getSignedUrlParams);
      return {
        signedUrl,
        contentType: contentType || '',
        extension: extension || '',
      };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error getting a signedUrl');
    }
  }
}
```

As part of my posts I’m going to make it a point to include some content beyond code.  I imagine this will likely take the form of a song I’m enjoying especially while writing code or an insightful article which may or may not be software related.  

I hope you got something out this article.  Feel free to provide any feedback by contacting me via email or social media.

As someone who's built enterprise applications in both React and Angular, I do love my frameworks and think they offer a lot of value.  That said, with any choice in technology its important to put thought into why you use or need them for your particular use case.
