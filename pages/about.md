I'm a software engineer based out of the greatest city in the world, New York, NY, with experience and interest in a variety of technologies related to building software products.  I have lead the engineering of software products, mainly web and mobile, for a myriad of clients across many industries including finance, health care, e-commerce, social impact, energy, and telecom.  Currently, I'm working BCG Platinion as a Lead Engineer.

Outside of the programming, here are some things that I enjoy and do:

* Music and concerts: From Trance to Blues and mostly everything in between
* CrossFit-style workouts
* Basketball
* New York Sports - Yankees, Giants, Knicks
* Roasting vegetables
* Wood working

I hope to use this blog as an avenue for my own learnings, but to also share my experiences with the world.
